# The Neurologist Appointment
It was about 1:20 when we started heading towards the hospital. It was a fairly calm drive; we are only 15 minutes away from the hospital. This was a pretty typical appointment, just going over the MRI scans I had done last week. I've definitely gotten worse over the past year due to the stress of living with my parents. Stress and anxiety definitely make my symptoms worse, and I am feeling that decline.


A year ago, I was able to walk back and forth in the swimming lane of the pool in town, but my healthcare insurance decided I no longer needed physical therapy and they won't pay for it. I really wish those decisions were made by healthcare providers, not by people handling money. I’m pretty sure that if I had been able to continue my pool therapy, I wouldn't have degraded as much.


We pulled into the drop-off area. There was a limousine in front of us, which is not unusual for this hospital; after all, this is a world-class facility. People come here from all over the world to receive treatment. That’s why I’m here. I moved from Colorado to Minnesota just to be close to this hospital, hoping I might get better someday.


The van stopped, and my mother got out. She pulled the restraints off my chair on the left side and closed the left sliding door. The right sliding door was already open, and the ramp was extending. My mom appeared on the right side and started unhooking my chair from the van.


"What's this appointment for?" she asked.


I exasperatedly sighed "It's just a follow-up."


Once I was unhooked and free to go, my mom returned to her seat, and I navigated down the ramp. I pulled my chair next to the revolving door and waited for my turn to get in. People here are pretty orderly, so it wasn’t much stress at all. There was an older lady with a cane, and her husband, with his hand on her back, stood in front of me. I waited for the next opening in the revolving door and pulled in, matching my speed to the door’s rotation.


I entered the hospital's security area. I don’t know why this is necessary in a hospital; it seems kind of silly to me. The older lady and her husband walked up to the security guard, a younger kid fresh out of college.


“Please go to desk three,” he told them.


I made my way to the security guard, and he directed me to desk number four. I slowly proceeded to desk four.


The security person there asked, “Do you have any bags?”


“No,” I replied.


“Do you have any guns or knives?”


Again, I replied, “No.” I wondered if that was an actual problem they’d had in the past.


I proceeded to the elevator vestibule. I pushed the up button and waited for the next elevator car. After about 15 seconds, I heard a ding and moved towards the correct elevator. Half a dozen people exited the car, one of them in a wheelchair. I waited for them to disembark before I slowly maneuvered into the elevator car. The older couple I saw earlier followed me in.


I asked, “Which floor do you need to go to?”


They replied, “Twelve.”


I was on my way to the 8th floor. I pushed the buttons for both floors. As the doors closed, I could feel the elevator lifting.


“This is our first time here. My wife is a little nervous. How is the service here?” the man asked.


“I have no complaints. The doctors seem to be respectful and knowledgeable.”


He started rubbing her back and smiled warmly at her. It does the heart good to see people who love each other. The elevator stopped at my floor.


“I’ll see you two later. Good luck with your appointment!” I said as I exited the elevator and proceeded to the south desk. There was nobody waiting, so I rode up to the desk.


The receptionist was on the phone. There were blinking red lights on the back of her computer monitor with a note saying, “When the lights are on, I’m on the phone.” I always thought that was such a cool thing to have. I waited patiently for her to finish.


She completed her call, turned to me, and asked, “What’s your name or clinic number?”


“Molly, S-Z-O-P-A,” I said, spelling my last name because people always get it wrong when I say it.


“And your date of birth?”


“May 15th, 1978.”


“Okay, you’re checked in. Please sit anywhere. They’ll call you from Door B.”


Door B was next to the reception desk. I pulled up about 15 feet from the door and parked out of the way of traffic. It was 1:40 now. I had almost a half-hour of waiting. The doctors here are usually pretty punctual. At most, I’d wait 20 minutes, plus an extra 10 if they were busy. I knew the neurology department was especially busy.


I decided to practice my Japanese while I waited. I opened my Multilingo app and turned the volume down a little bit so I wouldn’t bother other people. I started going through the practice lessons. This stuff is getting pretty easy and routine. I should probably move on to the next bit of content.


Just as I finished my first practice lesson, I saw a tall female doctor wearing fluorescent pink scrubs—right out of an '80s music video—walking towards the door I was in front of, her neatly tied-back blue hair standing out.


“I love your hair!” I offered.


She replied, “Thanks! I grew it myself!”


I smiled and thought to myself, “I really like her.” I couldn’t quite read her name tag, but I noticed there was a rainbow pin next to her name. “I love this place,” I thought to myself. She walked in the door and disappeared as it closed behind her. Seeing her put a big smile on my face.


I went back to my Japanese lessons, this time I started some new content. I was carefully studying the new kanji and trying to grasp their full meaning based on the kanji I already knew. This app doesn't do a good job introducing new content. There's a lot of guesswork and thought required to understand the meaning. Once the new words were introduced in the proper context of sentences, I was able to get a better understanding. This app is far from perfect, but the cost is very reasonable.


Shortly after 2:00 p.m., a nurse walked through the door in front of me and called my name. "Molly, please?" I waved at her as I sat myself up from a reclined position.


"How are you doing today?" she asked, not sounding particularly enthusiastic.


"I'm doing all right today," I replied.


"Good," she responded. "You'll be in Hallway C, Room 847."


She guided me to the room and told me the doctor would be with me shortly. I navigated my way into the room and parked myself to the side of the desk, between the couch and the exam table. The nurse closed the door behind her as she left. The doctors here don’t typically make you wait too long once you're in the exam room.


Just as my chair finished shifting into my desired tilted-back position, the doctor walked in.


"Hello, Molly. I’ve been looking at your MRI results. It looks like you've developed some new plaques on your brain. Mostly, the old plaques have become a little larger."


"That's not too much of a surprise to me," I told him. "I’ve noticeably degraded since I moved in with my parents. The stress has been a lot more than I want to deal with."


"So, the infusion medication hasn’t been working well for you?"


"No, I haven’t noticed any positive change whatsoever. If anything, I’ve developed allergies now. I’ve never had allergies before."


Just then, there was a knock on the door. It slowly opened, and in walked the blue-haired doctor I had seen earlier.


"Hello, I’m Dr. Candice Wilkins. I work with the neurological research team."


Dr. Johansen continued, "We would like to enroll you in an experimental study where we inject stem cells into your brain stem and spine."


Dr. Wilkins added, "Under a local anesthetic, we will inject the stem cells into your body in six locations based on your MRI imaging. This won’t cure the multiple sclerosis, but it will help heal the existing damage."


Having done some research on my own over the years, I knew that this was the most promising approach to counteract the degradation.


"I’m in," I replied without a second thought.


"That was a quick decision," Dr. Johansen quipped.


"I’m familiar with the disease and what it does, and how it needs to be treated. I know that this is our best shot given current medical technology."


Dr. Wilkins scoffed with a little laugh. "Current technology, huh? Here’s some paperwork so you can read more about the procedure." She handed me a folder filled with documents. I flipped through it as she continued, "We can schedule an appointment for you to undergo the procedure next week, but we'll need to take your blood so we can synthesize the stem cells. The procedure won’t take more than 45 minutes—mostly for the anesthetic to kick in and wear off."


Dr. Wilkins continued explaining the procedure, potential side effects, and what to expect. She said I should start noticing significant changes in my abilities after six months, based on animal testing.


After about 10 minutes of explaining the procedure and tests done on lab rats, Dr. Johansen informed us, "I will order labs to be taken after we finish here. Is that okay?"


"Of course," I replied.


"I look forward to working with you," said Dr. Wilkins as she held out her hand. I shook her hand and smiled. Both doctors stood up, and I tilted myself back into a riding position. I followed Dr. Wilkins out of the door, with Dr. Johansen behind me.


"You can get your labs done in the subway level of the Evans building," Dr. Johansen informed me. "If they can’t find the order yet, just tell them it’s for neurology."


"Thank you so much," I said to the doctors.


"I hope it works out!" replied Dr. Wilkins.


I navigated back into the waiting room and towards the elevators. I pressed the down button, and an elevator car immediately opened. I entered and pressed the button for the subway level.


The elevator went directly to the subway level. "Well, that's rare," I thought. I exited the elevator and proceeded to the Evans building. It’s a bit of a trek, but not too bad in my chair since it can go up to 10 km per hour. When I reached the phlebotomy waiting room, I checked in—same old procedure, name and birthday.


When I met with the phlebotomist, she was quite surprised. “Holy buckets! 10 vials of blood? That’s quite a bit. You may feel a little weak or tired after this. Make sure you eat a lot.”


I looked away because I can’t stand seeing the needle go into my body. I’m sure I would start feeling faint if I stared at it for too long. The phlebotomist inserted the needle into my vein without much trouble. I could tell she was very skilled.


“You’re definitely one of the better phlebotomists I’ve experienced,” I offered.


“Thank you, I try. I’ve been doing this for almost 10 years.”


After the 10 vials of blood were collected, she loosened the tourniquet, covered the puncture with gauze, and wrapped it with tape.


“Leave that on for about 20 minutes.”


“Thank you.”


I proceeded back to the main building and called my mom to pick me up. I went back up to the lobby level and exited through the revolving doors. Luckily, the temperature was still pleasant. I waited out of the way for my mom to arrive. I figured it would be a good time to continue my Japanese learning quest, so I fired up Multilingo again and started on the new lessons.


My mom arrived after 20 minutes or so. The door slid open, the ramp extended, and I navigated into my spot. My mom hooked me in with the restraints and asked, “How was it?”


I didn’t want to raise any false hopes, so I just said, “It was fine, no surprises. I am a little bit hungry, though.”

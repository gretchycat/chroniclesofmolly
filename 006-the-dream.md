# The Dream
I look down at my feet, toes buried in the warm sand, the grains soft and comforting against my skin. The sun's heat radiates through the ground, and I can feel the weight of my body pressing me into the earth. I wiggle my toes, sinking deeper, and the sensation makes me smile. The breeze is gentle, carrying with it the distant sound of waves crashing, and for a moment, I just stand there, taking it all in.


Then, without thinking, I start to run. My legs move easily over the sand, though it shifts beneath me, slowing me down just a little. When I reach the water, I kick at the cool waves, splashing them up around my ankles. The water is refreshing, and I keep running into it, feeling it rise to my knees, making each step a little harder. It’s like the ocean is trying to hold me back, but I push through, laughing at the resistance, my feet skimming the water’s surface as I go.


After a while, I turn and run along the shore. My legs feel lighter, and with each step, I leap higher and farther until suddenly, I’m flying. I look down and see the beach far below me, the line where the sand meets the water stretching out like a ribbon. The wind rushes past me, cool and exhilarating, and I breathe in the salty air, tasting it on my lips.


I fly faster now, the beach blurring below as I soar. The warmth of the sun fades as the landscape changes, the golden sand giving way to mountains covered in green. The air becomes cooler, crisp and fresh, filled with the earthy scent of trees. I glide over the forest, looking down at the pine trees, the dense greenery below. I can feel the freedom of it, the wind carrying me effortlessly over the mountain peaks, like I’m meant to be here.


Ahead, the mountains start to fade, replaced by a neighborhood. It’s familiar, yet strange, with winding streets and cozy homes nestled among the trees. The glow of streetlights makes everything feel warm, inviting. I hover in the air, looking down at the neighborhood, breathing in the calm that surrounds me.


I look up at the stars, and they seem frozen in place, like tiny pinpricks of light scattered across the sky. They don’t move or flicker; they just hang there, still and distant. The full moon glows brightly, casting a pale, almost eerie light over the world. It feels so close, like it's waiting for me to come to it.


Without thinking, I shoot toward the moon. The stars stay perfectly still, unmoving, like they’re watching me as I ascend. The only sense of speed comes from the wind rushing past my face, growing sharper and colder as I rise. The world below becomes smaller and smaller, but the stars remain locked in their places, constant and unwavering.


Higher and higher I go, but then I start to feel it—the air is thinning. Each breath becomes a little harder, the wind biting colder at my skin. My lungs struggle to pull in enough oxygen, and the chill seeps into my bones. My chest tightens, and I realize I’ve gone too far.


I let myself drop back down, the ground rushing up to meet me. The wind slows, warming as I descend, and I feel my lungs expand more easily with each breath. The cold releases its grip, replaced by the familiar warmth of the earth. I land softly, my feet once again grounded.


That’s when I feel it—something near me. I can’t see it, but it’s there, a presence close by, like it’s watching, observing quietly from the shadows. The air feels different, thick with energy, and a shiver runs down my spine. I glance around, but the presence stays hidden, just out of sight, though I know it’s close.


I wake up annoyed. This is the type of dream I particularly enjoy, and now I have to pee. It’s just after 2 a.m. I struggled to the commode the same way as when I got up that morning. I do my business, get back in my chair, navigate to the bed, an lay myself back down. I'm totally used to this constant sleep disruption. I wish I could get a full night's sleep. 


“I wonder how many more times I’ll wake up tonight.”

# Improvement?
"Good morning. The time is 9:00 a.m. You fell asleep at 11:42 p.m., and you slept soundly. Today, temperatures will range from -2° to 4° with 14% humidity. You have no appointments. Have a great day."
I opened my eyes as the ambient soundtrack shifted from insects and frogs to chirping birds. Rolling over, I smiled—somehow, I felt rested.
Lying on my back for a few minutes, I listened to the birdsong coming from my bedside smart screen. It was amazing how much speaker technology had improved over the past twenty years. I took a sharp inhale, filling my lungs before exhaling slowly.
Gripping the grab bar to the left of my head, I pulled myself up. It wasn’t exactly easy, but I struggled less than usual. Reaching my right hand toward the armrest of my chair, I pulled myself into it, then lowered the armrest. I plucked my phone from the microphone stand over my bed and attached it to the magnetic mount on my chair.
Next, I reached into the bag attached to the handhold by my pillow, grabbed my drink, and placed it in the cup holder. The movement of getting out of bed and into my chair had triggered a familiar pressure in my bladder. I navigated to the commode, pulled myself up using the handholds, and stood. Turning around, I uncrossed my legs from the spin, grabbed the grab bar in front of the commode to stabilize myself, and dropped my absorbent undergarment before sitting down.
As the fluid left my bladder, a realization hit me—I hadn’t woken up at all during the night to pee. Excitement washed over me; that hadn’t happened in years. I thought back to how I had felt upon waking—rested and energized.
"Could this be the first clue that the stem cell treatment is helping?" I wondered.
I immediately pushed the thought aside, recalling my doctor’s caution about drawing conclusions too soon. When I was finished, I used the handholds to push myself up, grabbed the grab bar in front of me, and pulled my absorbent undergarment back into place. I swung around and sat back in my chair—something I had become quite adept at.
Opening my phone, I navigated to my progress log, where I tracked spasticity and falls. I added a new entry:
2024/11/26
 For the first time in years, I didn’t wake up to pee in the middle of the night. I woke up energized.
I grabbed my external catheter, adjusted it over my bits, attached the bottle, then readjusted everything again.
Rolling over to Ruthie’s kennel, I plucked a shirt from the top of the stack and pulled it over my head. Everything seems easier when you’re well rested, I mused to myself.
Ruthie came running in to the room as I was getting dressed. She jumped on the bed and immediately started licking my face as I soon as my face was exposed after putting the skirt on over my head since I was sitting.
“It's really cold today, Ruthie. I don't think we can go on a walk today.”, I told her. She just sat down wagging her tail. She just looked at me and barked a few seconds later. “I can let you out into the backyard.”, I replied. I finished pulling the skirt down around my hips and rolled my chair over to the bathtub. I raised my foot rest with my feet. It seemed a little easier, but still very difficult. I grabbed the grab bar on the wall and pulled myself up to a standing position. I adjusted the skirt and let it drape down over my legs. I untucked my top from the skirt and plopped down in my chair. I adjusted myself into a comfortable position and excitedly said “let's go!”
Ruthie jumped down off the bed and let the way to the outside door. I unlocked the deadbolt turn the handle, and pulled the door open. Ruthie ran out excitedly. I closed the door a little bit to not let the heat escape. After a few seconds, Ruthie nudged the door open and came running in. I close the door after her and turned around. Do you want a cookie? I asked Ruthie. She immediately ran over to the box of dog treats. I pulled out four treats, turned around and asked her to shake. Of course she knew how to shake. So she presented her paw. Good girl, I responded and gave her one of the treats. She gobbled it down and came up to me for her next one. I asked her to speak, and after a little bit of growling and chomping in the air, she let out a confident bark. I gave her the second treat. We repeated that process with a lay down command, and a whisper command. And of course Ruthie was quite good at these tasks. “All done, Ruthie. You can have more later.” She tilted her head and walked over to her spot on the couch and hopped up onto the cushion.
Today, I was scheduled at the library to scan all my photos using their photo scanner. It was something that I've been wanting to do since I learned they have those resources. 
Ruthie's barking alerted my mom that I'm awake and she came down with a bowl of eggs and cut up hot dogs.
“Today, I'll be going to the library to scan all my photos. I will need to pull all of the photos out of my photo album.” she handed me the bowl of food and pulled the photo album off the shelf. She sat down on the couch next to Ruthie and started to pull all the photos out of the photo album, careful to keep the photos in order. “We can scan all of your photos too,” I told her. “Maybe another time,” she replied. I started eating my eggs and hot dogs bits. Ruthie came over and sat in front of me gazing into my eyes and occasionally looking at the food.  I'll give you some if you're good!” I told her. I managed to finish my breakfast while Ruthie silently watched. I left a little bit of eggs and hot dog in the bowl. I rolled over to Ruthie's Bowl and dumped what was left into her Bowl. She who stood up and walked over to her Bowl and chomped it all down.
I started rolling over to my desk and picked out a USB thumb drive to hold all the photos.
My mom got up and started walking over to me. ”Here are all your photos.” she informed me.” can you put them in an envelope for me?” she opened a drawer in the filing cabinet and pulled out a large manila envelope and carefully drive to the stack of photos into the envelope. She closed the envelope and handed it to me.” thank you.”
“Should we get going?” she asked.
“My appointment is at 1:00.” I informed her.

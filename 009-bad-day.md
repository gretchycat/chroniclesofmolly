# Bad Day
I woke up half a dozen times already to go to the bathroom. It's only 6:07, and yet again, I have to pee. Usually, it's 2 to 3 times a night, but now it's overwhelming. I'm exhausted. I can barely move, and I'll have to get up to go to the commode again. I struggle to flip onto my back first. I can barely pull the pillow from between my knees. I grab the handhold to the left of my head but fail to sit myself up. I heave an exasperated sigh, guide my legs off the side of the bed, and guess what—they're locked straight.


"Wonderful," I sigh exasperatedly. I focus on bending my knees as the urgency in my bladder sharply increases. I do my best to hold the fluid. Of course, I'm wearing an absorbent undergarment, but if too much fluid is released too quickly, it won’t hold. Since all the nerves in my lower body are short-circuited, my legs are stiff. I strategically decide to let go of the fluid, hoping my legs will release as well.


As I feel the tension in my bladder release, I quickly realize I'm not going to be able to stop the flow, and there's a lot more fluid than I anticipated. I feel it leaking out of the leg holes, cooling as it evaporates on the sides of my legs. I touch the bed, and yes, it's wet. I don’t want to wake my mother, but I might need to.


My legs did release, and I manage to sit up. I grab the right armrest on my chair and struggle to pull myself into the seat. Half of me is hanging off the front. One wrong move, and I’ll be on the ground again.


“Hey Nova, help.”


“Molly needs help.”


“Hey Nova, turn on the bedside lamp.”


The virtual assistant chimes as the lamp turns on.


I wait about 20 seconds and repeat, “Hey Nova, help.”


Apparently, my mom is in the middle of a dream or something. After repeatedly calling for help, I finally hear things knocking around upstairs. About 30 seconds later, I hear her coming.


“What can I—oh, dear Lord!” she exclaims. I’m barely on the chair, but I know I can recover.


“Help me bend my knees,” I urge. She walks over, placing one hand behind my right knee and the other on top of my foot, attempting to bend the knee. It’s really stiff.


“Try the left one,” I instruct.


It's also stiff but doable. She props my foot back against the closed footrest and goes back to the right knee. It’s still stiff. I can feel the strain starting to build. I know it will release in a violent spasm.


“I’m about to kick!” I shout frantically. My mom just turns to look at me questioningly.


“I’m about to—” Before I can finish, my right knee violently bends, causing my leg to jump upward. I feel it impact something. I look up and see I’ve unintentionally kneed her in the face. She grasps her right cheek from the shock.


“Oh my god, I’m so sorry!” I exclaim.


“I’m okay,” she reassures me.


 “I’ve also made a mess on the bed.” i inform her.


 I tilt my chair back to use gravity to push me into the seat. Since I’m not wearing a top and my back is sticking to the vinyl backrest, I have to walk my shoulders back to fix my position, occasionally lifting a shoulder to unstick it. I tilt my chair forward and proceed to the commode. I position my chair to lift me a foot or two so I can transfer over. I grab the handholds on either side of the commode and slowly pull myself forward. I spin left and collapse onto the toilet seat, nearly falling off, but manage to save myself.


“Pull the chair back and help me straighten out,” I instruct.


My mom looks lost. “Lift my left leg.”


As she lifts it off the ground, I can finally place my rear flat on the commode. I then use the handholds to push myself back a little. I exhale sharply and decide it’ll be easier to just rip the absorbent undergarment instead of standing to remove it—first the left, then the right.


“Can you look away?” I request.


I proceed to pull the front of the absorbent undergarment. It’s stuck a little under my right leg. I lift the leg with my hand while continuing to pull. I get the rest of it off and place it in the trash can. I adjust myself to maintain a minuscule amount of modesty.


“All done,” I inform my mom. “I think I need to take a bath.”


She reaches around me, grabs my swimsuit bottom, and threads my legs through the holes.


“Thank you,” I say meekly. As I rest from all that activity, my mom gathers the trash bag, ties it up, and inserts a new one.


“I’m going to try to get up now,” I tell her. She finishes with the trash and walks out of the bathroom to the other side of the wall. I muster all my strength to push myself up using the handholds. I try again, this time reaching the point where my legs can take over and push me up. Fighting with the co-contraction of my leg muscles, I manage to stand and pull myself toward the wall using the grab bar. I double-check that my legs are stable, let go with my right hand, and pull up the swimsuit bottom, covering my bits.


“Help!” I exclaim. My mom rushes back in and helps pull the swimsuit the rest of the way as my legs give out. I rotate into my chair as I collapse.


This time, I fall into the seat in an acceptable way. I take a second to regroup, then proceed to the bathtub. It’s one of those tubs with a built-in seat and a door you walk through—kind of like a one-person jacuzzi. My only complaint is I can’t stretch out. I swing up the latch and open the door. I measure the distance to place myself where I need to be for an easy transfer. I raise my chair by a foot like before, grab the bar next to the tub to pull myself up, stabilize using the door, and grab the other bar inside the tub to pull myself in. Slowly, I get my left foot in. My right foot is stuck on the tub’s lip. My mom lifts it in and places it on the ground. I use the handhold on my left to pull myself in enough to close the door. She closes and latches it.


With the door closed, I start the water. The temperature is set to 96°F—I don’t do well with water warmer than )(body temperature. As the water pours in, I turn on the tub lights and set them to rotate through colors.


“Can you get my phone and a drink?” I ask. She places my soda on the side of the tub and hands me my phone. I attach it to the magnetic mount, adjusting the gooseneck arm to a comfortable spot. As the water rises above the seat, I push myself forward a little and recline. It feels cramped but manageable. My knees have to stay bent in this position. Once the water reaches the fill line, I turn it off and start washing up after the accident.


I glance over and see my mom changing my bedding. I hate that this affects her so negatively too. I notice some bruising under her right eye. I feel horrible—nobody deserves this.


I hung out in the tub for a while, starting my Japanese practice and beginning a new lesson. I did some speaking practice and generic translation activities. After a while, I played some videos on social media and turned on the water jets. I stayed in the tub for a good hour and a half, watching videos and enjoying the solitude. My knees started to feel sore from being in the same position for so long. I guess it’s time to get out.


I raised the gooseneck arm up to the latch to put my phone out of the way and attempted to sit back on the seat. I placed my right elbow toward the back of the seat and rotated to the right, trying to push myself up. Every time I got close, I slipped back down to the semi-reclined position.


“Oofda,” I muttered in annoyance.


I pressed the button on the tub’s control panel and saw the temperature was at 103°F.


“No wonder I’m having trouble,” I thought to myself. I turned off the water jets. I hadn’t been watching the temperature, and the motors that push the water must have heated it up. I adjusted the temperature knob to the lowest setting and turned on the cold water while opening the drain to cool down the tub. Periodically, I checked the temperature gauge. When it reached 92°F, I turned off the water and closed the drain again. I figured I’d have to wait for a few minutes until my body reset.


I moved the gooseneck arm with my phone back in front of me and continued watching videos.


After about 20 minutes, I decided to try sitting up again. I moved the gooseneck arm out of the way and once more placed my right elbow on the seat beneath my head. It was still tough, but I managed to sit up this time. I straightened myself out in the seat and started draining the water. I removed my phone from the magnetic mount attached to the gooseneck arm and reattached it to my chair. I then grabbed my soda bottle and placed it in the cup holder of my chair.


Once the water had drained, I grasped the handholds on either side of the tub and tried to pull myself up. All of a sudden, my legs gave out, and I slid to the ground. It was a slow, controlled fall, but my position was very awkward.


“Hey Nova, help!” I called out.


“Molly needs help,” Nova announced through the smart speakers in the house.


I immediately heard activity upstairs. After a little while, my mom arrived, panicking.


“First, get my chair out of the way,” I instructed. “Next, get me stable on my back. You can pull me.”


I reached my arms up, and she helped me lower in a controlled manner to the ground on my back. She pulled me clear of the tub.


“Let’s get the sling set up.”


My mom placed the sling on the ground next to the bed as I struggled to crawl onto it. I felt like I weighed a thousand pounds. When my muscles start co-contracting, everything becomes infinitely more difficult. After a few minutes of struggling, I managed to crawl onto the sling. My left arm was stuck under my side. I tried to reach out to my mom for help, but I just couldn’t pull my left arm free.


“Pull my left hand,” I requested.


She took hold of my left hand, and I managed to flop onto my back. She straightened my legs and handed me the winch remote, holding the straps under my legs. I pressed the button to lower the winch, holding it down as the fork for the sling slowly lowered. When it was within reach, I grabbed it, continued lowering, and released the button when the fork touched my chest.


My mom started attaching the sling straps to the fork, starting with the lower left, then the lower right, and finally the back left and back right. I always verify that the straps are properly placed on the fork. I pressed and held the button to raise the winch. When my rear end was about 4 feet in the air, I stopped.


“Chair or bed?” she asked.


“I’ll get on my chair for now,” I replied.


She carefully positioned my chair beneath me, opened the footrest, and held me against the back of the seat. I lowered myself into the seat, feeling the backrest and then the seat beneath me. I continued lowering the winch until my feet were on the footrests. My mom removed the sling straps from the fork, and I raised the winch back up to the ceiling. I handed her the remote, and she hung it up on the wall.


She pulled the leg straps out from under my legs and set them aside. I reached out, and she pulled me away from the backrest so she could lift the sling from behind my back. I leaned back and relaxed, tilting myself back to regain some strength. After a few seconds, I tilted myself upright again.


“Can I have the catheter?” I asked.


“Here you go,” she replied.


I placed it over myself and ran the hose through the leg hole. My mom attached the bottle to the hose.


“Can I have a shirt, please?” I asked.


“Sure,” she replied, disappearing into the other room. She came back and helped me put it on.


I spent the rest of the day sitting in my chair. I had no strength left.

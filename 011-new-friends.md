# New Friends
On the Saturday night after the procedure, I decided to search for a new friend group. I looked for local communities of neurodivergent people and found one within minutes on a social app I used to frequent. I opened the app, navigated to their profile, and discovered that they had meetings every Sunday. I knew I had to join the next one. Immediately, I signed up for the group and added my name to the RSVP for tomorrow’s meeting.


Afterward, I took my medications, practiced my Japanese lessons, and went to sleep. My daily summary alarm went off.


"Hey Nova, help.’ I stated


“Molly needs help.", the smart speaker chimed.


A few minutes later, my mom walked into the room.


“What would you like to eat?” she asked.


“Nothing, I’ll eat later. I’m meeting friends at 11:00 today, and I’d like some help getting ready.” I reached up, asking for help getting out of bed. She grabbed my hand and began to pull me up.


“Legs first,” I reminded her. She helped move my legs down off the bed and onto the ground, then pulled me up to a sitting position. I transferred to my chair without too much trouble that morning. I got dressed, brushed my hair and teeth, scraped my tongue, and did all the other little hygiene chores. I told my mom I wanted to wear a colorful tunic-style top and some legging shorts. She fetched the clothes from the other room, and I got dressed with her help.


I took Ruthie out for a walk to the park once again. I had about an hour before I had to leave. When I returned home, i opened the gate to the backyard and proceeded to my door. I placed my finger on the fingerprint pad. “Unlocked”, chimed the door. I carefully navigated through the door frame with Ruthie in front of me. I bent down and unclipped her leash from her harness. “Go get your water, Ruthie”, I called. I unclipped my seatbelt and removed the leash. I hung the leash on the chair and sat back.


“Hey Nova, broadcast ‘It’s time to go.’”


The smart speakers chimed and repeated my message. We got into the van and made our way to the sports bar.


“I’ll call you when I’m ready to be picked up,” I informed her.


“Okay, have fun!” she replied.


I went inside and asked the waitress, “Are there any groups meeting here at 11:00?”


“The only group I know of is in the back room. The host’s name is Jason Smith,” she said.


That name didn’t sound familiar, so I decided to wait in an inconspicuous corner. Within a couple of minutes, I saw a small group forming. I drove over to them.


“Are you guys with the neurodivergent group?”


“Yes, we are!” the host replied in an excited tone. “I’m Cassie!”


I stuck out my hand. “I’m Molly. Nice to meet you.”


A few more people showed up over the next couple of minutes. I was kind of impressed with everyone’s promptness. Most social groups I’ve been a part of tend to have people trickling in late. A sports game was blaring on the TV behind me, and as the noise escalated, the entire group decided to move outside where it was quieter. That was a first, I thought. Usually, groups in sports bars revel in the noise.


I sat in the shade of a large umbrella protruding from the table. “You guys don’t mind if I take up the shade, do you? I have pretty extreme temperature sensitivity.”


They immediately showed concern, but I reassured them. “I’m okay here in the shade. It’s actually quite pleasant. The sun is just a bit harsh for me right now.”


I was shocked at their quick responses. I’d never had a group show such keen interest in what I said. I think I’m going to like this group.


The older lady across the table extended her hand. “Hello, I’m Melinda.”


I took her hand. “I’m Molly. Nice to meet you.”


“So, tell us about yourself, Molly,” she prompted.


The men at the table were engrossed in their sports conversation, while the women focused on me.


“I came here to Rochester, Minnesota, to get treatment at the Mustard Clinic,” I explained.


“Where were you before?” Cassie asked.


“I was in Fort Collins, Colorado. I used to be a software engineer before I moved here.”


Immediately, the men began reminiscing about sports teams in Colorado. They couldn’t have been listening to me, could they? Their conversation carried on, completely separate from mine.


“Are you paralyzed?” Melinda asked.


“No, I have multiple sclerosis. That’s why I’m here. If I’m going to get better, this is the place where it’ll happen.”


Cassie nodded. “A lot of people come here for the healthcare. I used to be an occupational therapist. Are you doing any physical or occupational therapy?”


“I used to love doing physical therapy in the pool. Being able to focus on my leg movements rather than fighting against gravity was huge for me. I tried it again recently, but I had way too much trouble. Getting back in my chair afterward was hellish. Now, most of my physical therapy is passive stretching. I hope that changes soon—I just had an experimental procedure where they injected my own stem cells into my spine.”


The men’s attention shifted to me.


“Tell us more about your computer work in Colorado,” one of them asked.


“Wow”, I thought, “I really like this group.” One of the men was playing on his phone without looking up, but the other was engaging with me.


“Most recently, I worked from home for a large corporation that provides cloud services. I’m kind of tired of making ridiculous amounts of money for corporations. I want to help people now. I’ve been considering substitute teaching.”


“Substitute teaching is easier than being a regular teacher. By the way, I’m Frank,” he said, extending his hand.


“I’m Molly.”


“I’m Jeremy,” the other man muttered, still looking down at his phone. He then asked, “What’s it like being stuck in the power chair?”


Meeting someone who doesn’t feel the need to mask was refreshing, I thought.


“The biggest issue is accessibility. Most places aren’t designed to accommodate people in chairs. On the bright side, I always have the best seat in the house,” I joked.


Everyone chuckled.


“That’s a really positive outlook to have!” Frank said.


Cassie, looking concerned, asked, “Do questions like that bother you?”


“Not at all. Jeremy asked out of pure curiosity. I actually hate when people are too careful about what they say around me.”


Jeremy clapped his hands, looked up, and pointed at me. “Thank you,” he exclaimed.


“I really admire that you’re unencumbered by masking or trying to act ‘normal,’” I told him, as he smiled and looked back at his phone.


“How old are you?” Cassie asked.


“I’m 46.”


“Do you have any family?”


“I have two kids—a daughter who’s 19 and a son who’s 15. They don’t really want to talk to me right now. They want no contact. I still talk to my ex-wife in hopes that will change, but I won’t push it. I have to respect their wishes, no matter how much it hurts.”


My eyes started to well up with tears, but I held them back.


“Ex-wife?” Cassie asked.


“I’m trans. I transitioned almost 15 years ago.”


“What did your ex-wife think about it?”


“I first came out to her in 2005. She was all for it until I mentioned hormones. She thought it was a weird fetish. I was in and out of the closet a few times before coming out for good around 2010.”


“Is that why your kids are no-contact?” she asked.


“No. When I had testosterone in me, I was a very angry person. They’ve mentioned a lot of trauma from that time. Testosterone was poison for me. My blood pressure dropped from 190/170 to normal when I started taking blockers. I truly believe transitioning saved my life.”


Seeing me getting emotional, the group gave me space. In the meantime, I installed an app on my phone that generated a QR code with my contact info. I shared it with everyone, and they scanned it one by one.


“That’s a cool system,” Frank said. “What happens after you scan it?”


“It just adds the contact to your phone,” Cassie replied.


“Great. I’m glad it’s self-contained and doesn’t forward you to a random site,” I acknowledged.


A couple of hours passed as we continued talking. I finally feel like I’ve found my tribe.

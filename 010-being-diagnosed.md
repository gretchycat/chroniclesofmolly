# Being Diagnosed
It’s been 20 years since multiple sclerosis crept into my life, but the hope this procedure offers feels like a small beam of light, piercing through the fog of two long, difficult decades. I can’t help but think back to when it all began—to the endless parade of symptoms that have marched through my body over the years. Some have faded into the background, like ghosts of what once was, while others lingered, stubbornly refusing to let go.


It was 2004. I spent my days behind the wheel, driving around Houston, Texas, as a computer repair technician. Fast food wrappers littered the passenger seat of my car—a testament to the kind of life I was living back then: fast, greasy, and hurried. One afternoon, I stopped at a little hamburger joint, ordered a sourdough burger, and ate it without much thought. The taste was forgettable, but what came after was not.


Later that night, I sprawled out on the couch, watching a faded old sci-fi movie about astronauts stranded on a planet ruled by apes. I slept soundly after the movie—but when I woke up, something inside me had changed. The world spun around me, a dizzying carousel that wouldn’t stop. The slightest movement of my head sent my body into freefall, though I hadn’t left my bed. 


It felt like my own body was betraying me.


Days passed before the dizziness subsided, but the fear stayed with me. My girlfriend, concerned, dragged me to the hospital. That’s when they told me—words that felt heavy, like stones dropped in my stomach. “It might be multiple sclerosis,” they said. But I refused to believe it. How could I? A disease with no cure, a shadow that would loom over me for the rest of my life? No. It had to be food poisoning. Something temporary. Something I could outrun.


But the symptoms kept coming, strange and relentless. One day, I woke up and couldn’t taste anything—not even the jalapeños on the burgers i enjoyed. Another day, the world grew quieter as I went deaf in my left ear. Once, I lost sight in one eye, the world turned to static on one side like someone had placed an old analog television across half my visual field. Each time, I clung to the hope that these things would pass. And they did, for the most part. But each time, they left something behind—a scar, an echo.


The worst, though, was when I lost feeling in my hands. I remember sitting there, holding a hamburger, unable to gauge how hard I was gripping it. I crushed it in my palms without meaning to. That was around the time my daughter was born. I was terrified to hold her. How could I trust these traitorous hands to cradle something so delicate, so precious? What if I dropped her? What if I hurt her without knowing?


And then, there were the constant pins and needles, crawling through my extremities like tiny electric shocks. They've been with me for so long now, they feel like old, unwanted companions.


For years, I refused the medications they offered. They were too expensive, with no guarantee of success. Besides, my body had healed on its own before—why wouldn’t it again? But eight years ago, I finally relented, and I’ve been paying for it ever since. My legs grew weaker, my balance less certain. I went from walking unassisted, to clinging to walls, to leaning on a cane, and eventually to the scooter, then the power chair that I now depend on.


I never cared much for sports, but now I miss the simplicity of movement—walking, running, swimming. The way my body used to bend and flex without effort. I took it all for granted. In my dreams, I still run, though the dreams grow rarer as the years pass. 


Just last year, I could walk the length of the pool, feeling the cool water against my skin, unburdened by gravity. But when I tried again recently, I barely made it a few feet before my body gave in. Still, the water felt like freedom, if only for a moment. 


I used to play the guitar. I used to ride motorcycles. I used to do so many things I never thought I’d lose. Now, even typing is a struggle. I can’t handle a mouse like I used to. I miss the independence, the feeling of contributing, of being useful.


This procedure—the promise of regaining even a fraction of what I’ve lost—it’s more than hope. It’s a lifeline. Maybe, just maybe, I can reclaim a little piece of who I used to be.

# The Procedure
I woke up with my alarm at 9:00 a.m. My appointment for the stem cell therapy procedure was at 11:00 a.m. I went through the full process of getting into my chair and getting dressed. It was a hard morning, but still doable. It's been about two weeks since I met with Dr. Wilkins and my neurologist. They have my stem cells ready to go and are waiting to inject them into my spine and brain stem. I'm not too sure about the details, but I'm confident it will have a positive effect. I ate some scrambled eggs and yogurt. Honestly, I’m kind of raring to go right now.


At 10:30, it was time to hop in the van and get going. The drive to the hospital was as uneventful as always. After all, it was a Tuesday at 10:30 a.m., and everyone was at work. It’s been such a long time since I’ve been able to go to work. Once I get well enough, I intend to get a job again. I used to be a professional software engineer, working for the big corporations and making them lots of money. But money doesn’t motivate me—it never really has. Although I chose computer science because I knew it would be a reliable money-maker, I think I want to get into teaching now.


We pulled up to the hospital’s drop-off area. The ramp retracted, my chair was loosed from the van, and I proceeded through the revolving doors I’ve become familiar with over the past few years. I made my way to the elevator lobby and pressed the button to call the next elevator. The doors slid open, and I waited for the people inside to exit. Once inside, I pressed the button for the 8th floor. Dr. Wilkins stepped into the elevator behind me.


"Hello, Molly," Dr. Wilkins exclaimed in an upbeat voice.


"Hello!" I replied.


The doors slid closed.


"Were you able to get enough stem cells?" I asked Dr. Wilkins.


"Oh, we have plenty. Everything went swimmingly."


The elevator doors slid open, and Dr. Wilkins stepped out.


"I’ll see you in the procedure room," Dr. Wilkins smiled.


I exited the elevator and proceeded to the check-in desk.


"I'm checking in for an appointment," I informed the receptionist.


"Name?"


"Molly S-Z-O-P-A," I replied.


"Birthday?"


"May 15th, 1978."


"Great, you’re all checked in. You’ll be called from door B."


I had about 15 minutes before my scheduled appointment, so I opened up Multilingo again and practiced my Japanese until I was called.


"Molly?" the nurse called from beside door B.


I raised my hand, tilted my chair back into a riding position, and followed her in.


"How are you doing today?" she asked in a very non-committal tone.


"I'm looking forward to trying this new procedure. I’m pretty excited."


"That's great," she replied.


She led me into a room and informed me, “The doctor would be with you shortly.” After a few minutes, Dr. Wilkins entered the room and greeted me again.


"I'll need you to take off all your clothes on the upper half of your body, get on the exam table and lie on your stomach."


I removed my top but needed help with the sports bra. Dr Wilkins helped me remove it. There was a toroidal pillow at one end—I assumed that’s where my face was supposed to go. I raised my chair to be higher than the exam table and asked for assistance to close the footrest. I dangled my feet, touching the ground with my toes, and pushed off onto the exam table, landing on my belly.


"I’ll need some help rotating myself over."


Dr. Wilkins then lifted my legs to the other side of the table as I rotated my face into position over the toroidal pillow.


Dr. Wilkins proceeded to push the joystick on my chair to push the chair backwards a few feet so that it wasn't in the way and explained, "The first thing we'll do is inflate this positioning cushion. This will open up the vertebrae so that we can inject into your spinal column. Then, we will numb the area around your cervical and upper thoracic spine."


I heard the buzzing of a pump as something inflated under my belly, causing my back to curve. The buzzing stopped, and Dr. Wilkins asked, "Are you comfortable?"


"I am experiencing no pain," I replied.


"Good," she responded.


There was a knock on the door, and it slowly opened. "Thank you, nurse," Dr. Wilkins said. I could hear something rolling into the room. I looked over and saw a cart with a metal tray on top, holding an assortment of syringes. I then felt Dr. Wilkins rubbing spots on my back with an alcohol wipe. The cooling sensation of the alcohol evaporating on my skin reinforced the reality of the situation. I knew this was my best chance to heal the damage in my central nervous system.


Once I stopped feeling the pressure of the alcohol wipe, Dr. Wilkins said, "Here’s the first set of pokes." I didn’t really feel the needle go in, but all of a sudden, I felt the pressure and the fluid being pumped in. Then, there was another spot nearby, and another.


"That wasn’t too bad, was it?" Dr. Wilkins asked.


"I have no complaints," I replied. The anesthetic shots weren’t as bad as I thought they would be.


"Let’s do the next spot now."


"Sounds good," I replied.


Once again, I felt the anesthetic go in, near the same area, and again. This continued for a dozen spots. I could feel the numbness spreading up my back. The shots on my neck actually stung a little, but it wasn’t too bad. I heard the refrigerator door open.


"Now, these are the big needles, full of your stem cells. These will hurt, even with the local anesthetic," Dr. Wilkins warned. The nurse, it appeared, had never left. "Here, hold onto this and squeeze as you feel the need," she said, handing me some squishy balls.


"Thank you," I told her.


"Are you ready?" Dr. Wilkins asked.


I nodded and then replied, "Yes, I’m a little nervous."


"I can’t interrupt the shot while it’s going in, but you can definitely rest between shots if you need to."


The first shot went into my upper thoracic spine, just above the bottom of my shoulder blades. As I felt the needle go in, the pressure was the most startling sensation. I squeezed the stress balls as the pressure increased with every second. I started groaning in discomfort.


"Okay, I’m injecting your stem cells."


I could feel the fluid entering, and I continued squeezing the balls as hard as I could. The pain and pressure gradually subsided.


"One down, five to go. Do you need a break?" Dr. Wilkins asked.


"Just a little bit," I replied.


After about 15 seconds, I told her, "I’m ready."


As Dr. Wilkins proceeded up my back, the pain got a little worse each time. The last two injections, at the bottom and top of my neck, were the worst. I needed a full few minutes of rest between them. After the final shot, Dr. Wilkins explained, "You should rest in that position for 15 to 20 minutes to allow the stem cells to move more freely up your spine and into your brain."


I could finally breathe. I dropped the squeeze balls and tried to relax all my muscles, focusing on my breathing—inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. I glanced at the clock. It all took about 45 minutes. Most of that time, I realized, was spent resting between injections. Apparently, I had waited much longer than just a few minutes during the last few injections. My judgment of time was skewed.


"You should start seeing improvements within a month or two. The changes should be fairly significant after six months. I’ll follow up with you in one week, then one month, and three months, and so on. I’d also like you to keep a time-stamped journal of any changes you notice. Anything out of the ordinary should be noted, even if it doesn’t seem significant."


"I understand," I replied.


"I’ll be back in 15 minutes or so," she informed me.


I tried to relax again and focus on my breathing. I reflected on the procedure and my hopes for recovery—planning what I wanted to do at different points along the way.


Dr. Wilkins re-entered the room. 


"Has it really been 15 minutes?,” I asked.


“I’ll help you get dressed and back into your chair," she smiled.


She flattened the inflatable cushion, and my back flattened with it. It felt strange for some reason. I struggled to flip onto my back and held out my hand for help. Dr. Wilkins grasped my hand and helped pull my legs down off the edge of the bed and assisted me in sitting up. I raised my arms as she helped pull the sports bra over my head, guiding my arms through the holes and pulling it down over my chest. We repeated the process with my top.


"I’ll need to drop the power chair to its lowest position. It’s the bottom left button when you’re sitting in the chair."


She pushed it, but nothing happened.


"You need to hold the button down," I informed her.


The chair slowly dropped to its lowest level, the motor slowing as it neared the bottom.


"Okay, that’s perfect," I said.


I held out my right hand, and she grasped it to help stabilize me as I lowered myself off the table. I grabbed the armrests of my chair and rotated myself into it, but I wasn’t seated securely.


"Can you get my footrests?" I asked.


She lowered the footrests and helped me place my feet on them. I tilted the chair back to let gravity push me into the seat, then tilted it forward into a driving position. I looked up at Dr. Wilkins and said, "Thank you so much. I really hope this works."


"Me too," she replied. "This is experimental, so we need to keep close tabs on your progress."


Dr. Wilkins explained what I should look out for, including stiffness and increased spasticity, until the healing process begins. "I’ll schedule a phone interview with you every other day until your one-week appointment."


"I’m looking forward to this," I said as I rolled toward the door. "Do I need to set up anything with scheduling?"


"No, I’ll handle that. Just focus on any changes you experience and make a note of them for me."


"Will do."


I proceeded to the elevator lobby, pushed the down button, and entered the elevator when it arrived. I rode down to the lobby level and called my mom to pick me up as I exited the revolving doors to wait in the pickup area.

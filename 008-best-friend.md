# Best Friend
When I got home, I took Ruthie out for a walk. As always, she was super excited to see me. I stopped with Ruthie at our usual spot under the tree and made myself comfortable. I practiced my Japanese for a while, as I often do, and then decided to text my friend Willow: "I just got done with the stem cell thing! I'm super excited to start getting better, maybe."


She wouldn't be able to respond for a while since she works as an elementary school teacher. I lay under the tree in my chair, daydreaming about how my life might improve. First, I'll get a job again—this time, something I’ll enjoy—a job where I can help people. Next, I'll get my own place and maybe become roommates with a close friend. I’d love for that close friend to be Willow, but she lives 15 hours away by car. Maybe I'll get my driver's license again and visit her!


Willow and I had known each other for four years at that point. It all started when she began joining my live streams. I used to go live almost every day, and she was there most of the time. About nine months ago, we started talking about traveling around the world and sharing adventures together—everything from visiting different countries to going on a road trip across the country.


Eventually, I told her that she had become someone incredibly important in my life—someone who had made a huge impression on me. I admitted that I wanted us to be a couple. I don’t usually go for long-distance relationships, but I felt this connection was meaningful. So, we became a couple.


However, just a few weeks ago, we broke up because she didn’t have the patience to wait an unknown amount of time before we could even meet in person. I had tried to make it happen on several occasions, but it never worked out. Despite the breakup, the bond between us remains incredibly meaningful to me, and I couldn’t imagine not having her in my life.


We can talk about anything and never get bored. Through this connection, I’ve learned a lot about myself—like how I can converse with anyone about almost anything—as long as our personalities are compatible. She’s neurodivergent too, so we could truly be ourselves around each other. Our quirks and tics didn’t matter. We didn’t have to mask. Conversations could change direction mid-sentence, and neither of us had trouble following along. I’ve never known a connection like this one.


Before I knew it, it was 2:30, and I got a video call from Willow. When I picked up, I could see she was in her car, the background not moving.


"Stuck in the parking lot again?" I asked.


"Tell me how it went!" she insisted.


"The injections were super unpleasant, but I got through it. It took about an hour with all the resting between shots. They tell me I should see significant improvements in six months. I'm sure I'll notice little things here and there before then."


“How was school?” I asked playfully.


“Remember I was talking to you about Ernesto? Well, his mom came up and started yelling at me because her son is not doing very well. I've made all the accommodations I can, but it still isn't working out. I really want to help him, but his understanding of the English language just isn't sufficient anymore. I suggested to her that her son should be put in a specialized English as a second language course, but she refuses. I'll never understand why the teachers' recommendations are rarely taken seriously by parents.”


Willow looked visibly shaken.


“You don't deserve to be treated like that," I said. "Did you escalate the issue to the higher-ups?”


“I did," she replied, "but it's still not fair. I do everything I can for these kids.”


“These kids love you," I reassured her. "How many of them have told you that you are their favorite teacher? You're doing your best, and I'm very proud of you. The fact that so many of the kids love you so much, and that you receive compliments from other faculty about the behavior of the kids you work with—it speaks volumes.”


“Thank you,” she sighed.


Ruthie woke up from her nap, hearing all the talking. She stood up and vigorously shook her coat, sending ripples through her body as the sleep fell away. She sat in front of me, looking at me with her tongue hanging out.


“I think Ruthie wants to get going," I said. "We can stay on the phone for as long as you need. Do you have any plans for today?”


“Once I get home, I intend to get in the bath and maybe watch a movie.” she muttered, her face expressing exhaustion from today's events.


“Would you like to watch something together?” I asked, hopefully.


“Sure,” she replied. “Thank you for listening and being there for me.”


“It's what friends do,” I smiled.


I started heading home with Ruthie as Willow and I continued talking about her drive home and the bad drivers around her.

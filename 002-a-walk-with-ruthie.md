# A Walk With Ruthie
“Hey Ruthie, come here, pupper!” I called. In pranced my red-nose pittie mix. I adopted her with my ex-girlfriend eight years ago when she was just a year old. She’s my ESA, and I love taking her on walks every day, weather permitting.


She jumped onto the bed next to where my chair was parked. I leaned in and softly whispered into her ear, “Would you like to…” Before I could finish, she started getting excited, frantically giving me all the puppy kisses. I continued in an excited and loud voice, “Go outside?” She jumped off the bed, ran to her toy box, picked out her favorite orange octopus stuffy, and began shaking it wildly. Then, she dashed down the hallway to the living room as I followed her.


“Where’s your leash?” I asked. She walked over to the chair where it was hanging. I grabbed the purple leash, looped the handle through my seatbelt, and buckled up. I attached the other end of the leash to her harness, navigated to the door, unlocked it, and twisted the handle while pulling to open the door. I backed up a little to open it fully, and we went outside.


Ruthie still behaves very much like a puppy. She doesn’t show any signs of joint pain, and she doesn’t even have gray hairs yet. I desperately hope she can stay happy and healthy for a long time. We proceeded down the neighborhood roads toward the park. There are sidewalks, but they’re very uneven and bumpy due to the constant freezing, icing over and thawing over the winters. For me, on the power chair, the road is a much better option. Also, if someone else is walking their dog nearby, they’re usually on the sidewalk. Since Ruthie is connected to my chair, it’s easier for me to move out of the way on the road than to navigate through the grass.


The street my house is on is fairly smooth, but to get to the park, I have to navigate through some cracked and broken roads. I adjusted the speed control on my chair to go a little slower on these rough stretches of road. The bumpiness can have a negative effect on my bladder and bowels.


We made our way to the park, and I stopped my chair under a tree, reclining into a comfortable resting position. Ruthie spotted some other dogs across the big open field and watched them intently. The other dogs were off their leashes.


“I wish I could let you off-leash too, Ruthie, but you’d just run off to play—or fight—with the other dogs!” I said. She looked back at me. I doubted she understood the words, but she enjoyed the interaction. I opened my language learning app, Multilingo, and started my Japanese practice. I have been doing a lot of review lessons rather than learning new things lately. I justified it by telling myself that I wanted to master the current material before moving on to the next lesson.


I don’t know any Japanese people, but I love Japanese culture and the atmosphere of rural Japan. Visiting or even living there is definitely on my bucket list. I’ve developed a distaste for the loud and self-centered way of life here. But for now, being disabled and without a significant income or the capacity to work full-time, it’s not realistic to make that dream happen.


After about half an hour of practice, Ruthie began to get excitable.


“Do you want to go to a new place?” I asked. She came up to the right side of my chair and licked my hand. While I was busy with my lesson, she had managed to get herself tangled around my headlight.


“Oof, I’ve got to fix this first,” I muttered. I adjusted the backrest to a more vertical position and bent down as far as I could, still a couple of inches short of reaching the headlight. I kept pushing myself lower, battling against muscle spasticity rather than flexibility issues, until I finally reached the leash and untangled it. Ruthie was free!


I reset my chair to a more comfortable riding position, backed up, and returned to the sidewalk. We moved about 500 feet forward when Ruthie started sniffing at the grass under another tree.


“Is this where you want to be now?” I asked. She responded by rolling onto her back, squirming in pure joy with her tongue hanging out. I pulled into the grass under the new tree and got comfortable again. I could hear children playing in the school playground nearby. It warmed my heart to be able to experience this. If I were working full-time, I wouldn’t have this freedom anymore. I absolutely love being out here with Ruthie, relaxing and gazing at the sky.


“Ruthie, would you like to listen to some music?” She looked at me blankly and continued rolling around. I opened the music app on my phone and started an '80s playlist. I love having the freedom to do this, but it’s unfortunate that the rest of life is so hard.


After another half hour, I asked, “Hey Ruthie, are you ready to go home?” She jumped up. I adjusted my chair back to cruising mode, and we took a different path to head home. Our trip home was uneventful. Once inside, I unclipped my seatbelt, loosening the leash from my chair. I detached Ruthie’s harness, and she was free to roam.


“Go get some water,” I urged. She went straight to her bowl and started lapping up water. My mother walked in and immediately asked, “Would you like some food?”


“One sandwich is fine,” I replied. It was around 12:30, just an hour before I needed to leave for my neurologist appointment. When my mother returned with the sandwich after 15 minutes, I told her, “I have a doctor’s appointment at 2:00, and we need to leave around 1:30.”


Of course, she asked what the appointment was for. “That’s private information,” I replied. I don’t trust my parents with anything related to my health. I’m 46 years old, and they still treat me like I’m 15. This is not an environment I would choose to live in. Other than the multiple sclerosis, I’m as healthy as people get, and I’m thankful for that every day. I take good care of myself. I eat as healthily as I can. I don’t follow diets or fads. I eat whatever foods I crave. If I want candy or chocolate, I eat it. Nothing is taboo. I never eat to excess, and I stay hydrated. Lately, I’ve been splurging on lemon-lime soda, though I typically drink unsweetened hot tea, preferably just a little warm. My temperature sensitivity, thanks to the multiple sclerosis, makes hot beverages uncomfortable.


I finished my sandwich and had a tub of yogurt. I continued listening to my music until around 1:15. “Hey, Nova, help,” I called out. The speakers announced, “Molly needs help.” My mom came down and asked what happened.


“I’m ready to go to my appointment.”


“Isn’t it a bit early?” she asked.


“It’s fine.”


Ruthie was lying on the couch. As I was leaving, I looked back at her and said, “Be a good girl, Ruthie.” She wagged her tail and laid her head back down. I went out the door and around the house to the driveway. My mom backed the van out of the garage and stopped in front of the sidewalk where I was waiting. The side door slid open, and a ramp slowly extended from under the door. I turned my speed down to indoor mode, tilted my chair upright, and carefully drove up the ramp. Once inside, I maneuvered to face forward and backed up to the edge of the back seat, where I stopped. My mother attached my chair to the car using hooks on flat belts. She pressed the button to close the doors. The ramp retracted, and the sliding doors closed. My mother slowly backed out of the driveway and drove me to the hospital.

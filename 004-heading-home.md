# Heading Home
"Would you like a hamburger?" she asks.


"Sure, that's fine."


We pulled out of the drop-off area and headed home. I tilted myself back and closed my eyes to relax for a bit. My mom tried to engage me in small talk. "The weather sure is nice, isn't it?"


I replied simply, "It's fine."


Hopefully, she understood that I didn’t want to participate in small talk. I despise it. My neurodivergent brain hates wasting energy on meaningless chatter.


I started thinking about what Dr. Wilkins had said. I know there's a small chance of tumors, but I also know that I don’t fill my body with strange chemicals like nicotine, fake sugar, or anything else. I flipped through the packet of papers I received and scanned for the words "tumor" or "cancer" in the side effects section. As I suspected, it mentioned giving up smoking, alcohol, or anything similar due to the risk of tumors. I felt reassured that the lifestyle I lead—rejecting drugs, alcohol, nicotine, and fake sugars—makes me a good candidate for this treatment.


For the first time in the 20 years since I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, I have high hopes that this course of action will adequately address the symptoms of this curse. I know this won't stop my immune system from attacking my myelin, but it should definitely repair previous damage if all goes as planned.


We pulled into the Burger Master drive-thru. I continued flipping through the packet as my mom ordered the food.


"One Super Burger Junior with large fries."


I couldn’t make out what the drive-thru attendant said or the total price, but we started pulling forward. There was a car in front of us at the pickup window, and I kept flipping through the papers. It said that I should start seeing improvements in my ability after six months. I know my body heals relatively quickly, so I’m sure I’ll see something sooner. I really dread those injections, but I'm looking forward to finally getting better. Injections into the spine, from personal experience, are stupidly painful—even with local anesthetic. But it’s worth it.


My mom pulled forward again and stopped. She opened her window, and I heard the attendant say, "$10.87." My mom started pulling cash from her purse. I don’t know why she still insists on carrying cash, but it’s fine. It doesn’t really bother me; I just wonder about her reasoning. She grabbed the paper bag and started driving away. It bothered me a little that she didn’t say thank you, but it’s not something worth bringing up. She handed me the bag with a smile on her face.


"Thank you," I said.


I don’t particularly like eating in a moving car, especially since I have so much trouble with my hands. I just put the bag down on top of the packet of information on my lap and leaned my head back against the headrest, closing my eyes again.


"You're not going to eat right now?" my mom asked.


Without opening my eyes, I replied, "I'll wait until we get home."


During the drive home, I daydreamed about what it would be like to be normal again.

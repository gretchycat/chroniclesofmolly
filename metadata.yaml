description: |
  The Nation of Ethica is not just a book—it’s an open invitation to imagine, create, and inhabit a society built on universal ethics rather than arbitrary borders.

  Part manifesto, part constitution, part guidebook, this volume outlines the founding myths, living principles, and playful traditions of Ethica: a micronation born from the desire to turn compassion, transparency, and honest inquiry into shared practice.

  Inside, you’ll find a declaration of independence, a modern constitution rooted in radical consent and truth-telling, the stories of Ethica’s chosen patron figures, and practical ways to bring ethical citizenship into everyday life.

  Whether you are curious, critical, or ready to join, this book is for anyone who dreams of a more intentional and humane world—one community, one story, one act of kindness at a time.

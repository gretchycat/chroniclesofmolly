# Home Again
When I got home, I waited for my mom to loosen the hooks, and I disembarked using the ramp. I went to my entrance at the back of the house. I live in the basement since it’s the only place I can access in this split-level home. I’ve never even been to the main floor. The basement is fully finished and modified for accessibility. It’s not perfect, but it’s where I live for now.


I entered my room and noticed it felt a little warm.


"Hey, Nova, I’m hot."


The ceiling fan turned on, but since the lights are on the same circuit, the overhead lights came on too. After about 15 seconds, the lights turned off. I have this routine set up, though I wish the lights were on their own circuit. I parked my chair in the usual spot between my bed and Ruthie’s kennel. Ruthie followed me into the room and hopped onto the bed next to me. I reached my left hand toward Ruthie and stroked behind her ear.


"You're a good, sweet girl, Ruthie," I said, to which she responded with lots of puppy kisses.


I opened my phone, started a playlist of space videos on MyTube, and relaxed while eating my burger. After a while, my mom walked in, asking if we could watch our shows together. My mom and I like to watch anime after she finishes her housework. It’s the only time she sits down to rest, and getting her to relax has been a challenge, so I never say no. I started our shows, and we watched for a few hours. She really enjoys the ones about young love.


I started feeling tired. Before she left, I asked my mom to help me take off my dress. I went to my spot next to the tub where I can stand somewhat safely, and she helped me lift the skirt. My legs gave out, and I sat back down in my chair. I rolled backward a little, lifted my hands, and my mom helped pull the dress over my head. I emptied my catheter bottle, removed the catheter, and washed myself up with a fresh, wet washcloth.


Next, I navigated to a spot beside my bed. I tilted myself upright and started adjusting my chair to lift me a few inches, so I was higher than the bed's surface. My mom, familiar with the routine, raised my footrest. I scooted forward to the edge of the chair, raised my left armrest after removing my drink and plucking my phone from its mount. I tossed my phone onto the bed and handed my mom the drink.


I placed my right hand on the chair’s armrest and my left hand on the bed’s surface. My legs dangled, just touching the floor. I shifted my weight onto my legs, focusing on keeping my knees from bending, and transferred myself onto the bed. I lowered the chair to its lowest position, grabbed the handhold near the head of the bed, and pulled myself, trying to get my legs onto the bed. I always try to do this part alone, but I often need help, especially when my right leg is locked straight.


I managed to get my legs onto the end of the bed—my left knee bent and my right leg straight. Using my shoulders and left leg, I pushed myself back on the bed. It’s not easy, but eventually, I got there. I paused for a few seconds to let my muscles relax. Unfortunately, what usually happens next is that my left leg starts kicking violently. Tonight was no different. My mom, from personal experience, knew to stay clear when I warned her it might happen.


I grabbed the phone I had tossed onto the bed earlier and attached it to the magnetic mount. Finally, I could relax.


"I think I’m safe now. Thank you. Good night," I said.


"Good night," she replied as she left the room.


I opened Multilingo again and started practicing my Japanese. After 15 minutes, I’d had enough. I took all my medication and started playing a space podcast.


"Hey, Nova, good night," I called.


Nova began executing my nighttime routine: playing nighttime sounds, setting the bathroom lights to red at minimum brightness, turning off all the lights except for my bedside and the red bathroom lamp, making sure the door was locked, and telling me about tomorrow’s weather. The last thing Nova would do is dim the bedside lamp over the next half hour.
I didn’t feel like waiting for the lamp to dim.


"Hey, Nova, turn off the bedside lamp."


I held out my hand, letting gravity help me roll over with my heavy memory foam pillow. I placed my cooling pillow between my knees, adjusted my head pillow, and pulled my heavy pillow closer to my chest. Listening to the podcast, I fell asleep after 15 minutes.

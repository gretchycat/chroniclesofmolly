# Waking Up
“Good morning. The time is 9:00 a.m.. you fell asleep at 1:47 a.m., you woke up four times and you sleep was restless. Today, the temperatures will range from 18° to 27° with 63% humidity. You have one appointment today.  Dr Hans Johansen  at the Mustard Clinic at 2:00 p.m.. Have a great day.”


I opened my left eye and looked down. I was completely uncovered, as usual. I typically don't wear anything to sleep besides and absorbent undergarment. I was hugging my large, heavy memory foam pillow. I had a cooling pillow between my knees although, as usual, the inside of my thighs were burning up. I was laying on my right side with my right arm under another memory foam pillow outstretched in front of me with my head upon the pillow and my left hand resting beside my face.


I sighed. I guess I should get up. I lifted my left knee and pulled the pillow from between my legs. Bending my right elbow, I tried to prop myself up a bit and shifted onto my back. I glanced at my clock, which doubles as my virtual assistant. It was 10:07 a.m.


I grabbed the handle of the grab bar to the left of my head with my right arm and struggled to get myself into a seated position. I looked over at my power chair to my right and grabbed the right armrest with my right hand. Mustering as much strength as I could, I carefully activated the muscles in my calves and the tops of my thighs to hop myself onto the chair.


I lowered the left armrest and reached over to pluck my phone from the magnetic phone mount above my bed, attaching it to the chair. I took the bottled soda from the pocket on the grab bar to the left of my head and placed it in the cup holder on my chair. I flipped the power switch on my chair, waited a few seconds for it to boot up, and rode my chair to the commode.


Grabbing the supports next to the commode, I pulled myself up, carefully activating only the calf and thigh muscles again, to stand in front of it. Once standing, I reached behind me with my right arm and grabbed another grab bar on the wall in front of the commode. I twisted around, crossing my legs in an X, and sat down on the commode. I attempted to engage the right muscles to untwist my legs, then grabbed the handholds on either side of the commode and mustered all my strength to push myself up.


Once I was mostly standing, I let go with my right hand, grabbed the grab bar in front of me, and pulled myself toward the wall to stabilize. I finally pulled down the absorbent undergarment and sat back down on the commode to release the fluids. I reached for a clean washcloth from the stack behind me, turned on the sink to my left, and wet the cloth to clean myself up. I finally started breathing calmly again.


Heaving a sigh, I looked for my external catheter. I cupped it over myself, aligned it carefully, and led the hose through the right leg hole. I spread my legs apart and adjusted it one more time. I pulled up the absorbent undergarment as high as I could while still sitting, then pushed the joystick to move my chair back a bit because it was too close.


Grasping the grab bars on either side of the commode again, I pushed myself up, mustering all the strength I could into my legs. I pulled myself to the wall using the grab bar in front of me to stabilize. I pulled up the absorbent undergarment, let go with my left hand, and let gravity rotate me into my chair. I wasn’t sitting straight and could tell I would fall out if I moved incorrectly.


"Hey Nova, help," I said.


The virtual assistant broadcasted to all the smart speakers in the house, “Molly needs help.” I could hear my mom rushing downstairs from upstairs. She came into my room and asked, “What can I do?”


I pointed down at my legs and asked, “Can you help me bend them?” She bent my legs, starting with the left, then the right. The right one was a bit more stubborn. I grabbed the armrests on my chair and straightened myself out.


"Now, I need my footrests." She lowered them, placing my feet on top. I reached out my left arm; she grabbed it and pulled. This was a common occurrence. She pulled me up so that my back was vertical and no longer leaning against the backrest. I let go of my mother's hand and grasped the armrests again. She placed her hand on my back, pulling me slightly forward so I wouldn’t prematurely fall back against the backrest. I lifted myself up slightly and scooched back until my bottom was against the back of the seat. She let go, and I relaxed for a few seconds.


I grasped her hand again to sit fully upright, away from the back of the seat. She helped me put on a dress and straightened it out. I pointed at the grab bar next to my tub. She knew I was ready to adjust the skirt of the dress. She lifted the footrest again, and I drove to the grab bar next to the bathtub. I made sure my knees were bent correctly, straightened out my feet, and my mother helped me place them flat on the ground. I used the grab bar to pull myself up. The skirt draped down as it should, and my mother adjusted it as needed.


I sat back down in my chair and backed up. My rear wasn’t against the back of the chair again, but this time, since I was dressed, my back wouldn’t stick to the backrest if I allowed gravity to move me into the correct position. I tilted the chair back so that the backrest was flat and the seat was vertical. I pushed off the armrests a bit and let myself fall several inches against the backrest. I then tilted myself back to a normal sitting position.


My mother asked if I was hungry. I’m never really hungry right after waking up, so I told her, “I’ll let you know when I get hungry.” She then helped me brush my hair, scrape my tongue with a makeshift tongue scraper made from a strategically cut plastic coat hanger, and brush my teeth with a miswak stick. I grabbed my pill boxes and carefully emptied the correct container into my mouth and took a swig of my drink. I then took my second pill box and emptied it under my tongue for those pills to dissolve.


I was ready for my day.
